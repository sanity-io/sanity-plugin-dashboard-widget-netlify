## Developing plugin kit

### Test

This plugin uses [@sanity/plugin-kit](https://github.com/sanity-io/plugin-kit)
with default configuration for build & watch scripts.

### Release new version

Run ["CI & Release" workflow](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-netlify/actions/workflows/main.yml).
Make sure to select the main (or v3) branch and check "Release new version".

Semantic release will only release on configured branches, so it is safe to run release on any branch.
